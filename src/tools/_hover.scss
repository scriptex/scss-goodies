/// Detailed info about the Hover CSS Media Feature can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/hover).
/// This media query is implemented in almost all modern browsers and works as expected.
///
/// The modern browsers include Chrome, Opera, Safari, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, etc.
///
/// Internet Explorer and Firefox do not understand this media feature and therefore will
/// simply ignore all rules inside the query.
